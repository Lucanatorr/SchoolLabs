Exercise 1:
  Answer A:
    - > hand_vector <- c("Right", "Left", "Left", "Right", "Left")
      > hand_factor <- factor(hand_vector)

  Answer B:
    - > print(hand_factor)

  Answer C:
    - > str(hand_factor)
       Factor w/ 2 levels "Left","Right": 2 1 1 2 1

Exercise 2:
  Answer A:
    - > survey_factor <- factor(survey_vector,
      +                  levels = c("R", "L"), labels = c("Right", "Left"))
  Answer B:
    - > print(survey_factor)
      [1] Right Left  Left  Right Right
      Levels: Right Left
  Answer C:
    - > summary(survey_vector)
      Length     Class      Mode
        5 character character
      > summary(survey_factor)
        Right  Left
            3     2
      It really depends on the use case of summary.  In the case that you want to know how many data points are in each
      level, then the summary of the factor is much more useful.  If you want to know what type of data is in the factor,
      then the summary of the vector is more useful.  Both have their uses.

Exercise 3:
  Answer A:
    - > animal_factor <- factor(animal_vector)
  Answer B:
    - temperature_factor <- factor(temperature_vector, ordered=TRUE, levels=c("Low", "Medium", "High"))
