Exercise 1a:

    > my_numeric <- 42

Exercise 1b:

    > my_character <- "forty-two"

Exercise 1c:

    > my_logical <- FALSE

Exercise 2a:

    > my_apples <- 5

Exercise 2b:

    > print(my_apples)
    [1] 5

Exercise 2c:

    > print(my_oranges <- "six")
    [1] "six"

Exercise 2d:

    > my_fruit <- my_apples + my_oranges
    Error in my_apples + my_oranges: non-numeric argument to binary operator
    This does not work because you cannot perform mathematical operations with the type Character.
    You can fix this by coercion(as.<type>).  In this instance it would look like:
    > my_fruit <- my_apples + as.numeric(my_oranges)

Exercise 3:

    Answer is D.

Exercise 4a:

    > var1_char <- as.character(var1)

Exercise 4b:

    > typeof(var1_char)
    [1] "character"
    > class(var1_char)
    [1] "character"
    > mode(var1_char)
    [1] "character"

Exercise 4c:

    > var2_log <- as.logical(var2)
    > class(var2_log)
    [1] "logical"

Exercise 4d:

    > var3_num <- as.numeric(var3)
    Warning: NAs introduced by coercion
    > print(var3_num)
    [1] NA
    > class(var3_num)
    [1] "numeric"
    There's a part success in this as var3_num is assigned a class of numeric.  However it's unsuccessful in the sense
    that it loses it's value, because "i" does not translate to a numeric value it's assigned "NA".

Exercise 5a:

    > age_clean <- as.numeric(age)

Exercise 5b:

    > employed_clean <- as.logical(employed_clean)

Exercise 5c:

    > salary_clean <- as.numeric(salary)
