Question 1:
    Answer: P, T
Question 2:
    Answer: gcd(a,b) 				== gcd(b,a mod b)
            gcd(312,220)			== gcd(220, 312 mod 220)
            gcd(220,92)			    == gcd(92, 220 mod 92)
            gcd(92, 36)			    == gcd(36, 92 mod 36)
            gcd(36, 20)			    == gcd(20, 36 mod 20)
            gcd(20, 16)			    == gcd(16, 20 mod 16)
            gcd(16, 4)				== gcd(4, 16 mod 4)
            gcd(4, 0)				== 4
