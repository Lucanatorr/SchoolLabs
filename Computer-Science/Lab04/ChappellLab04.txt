Question 6:
    Answer: CSMA/CD isn’t compatible with wireless networks, because once a wireless packet is transmitted from the starting point,
     the transmitting machine has no awareness of it’s transmission possibly colliding with another on the network, because it is not wired.
     Another possible reason, is because the machines communicating with the Access Point, may be out of signal range of each other, which
     would lead to the machines not being able to detect that other machines on the network are also transmitting to the Access Point at the
      same time.
